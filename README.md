# Goals
## A Mobile Editor
There are people being born today who probably won't ever own a laptop or PC, but will have a smartphone. Traffic on websites is trending towards mobile, and as the capacity of smartphones increases the justification for purchasing a laptop dwindles. If its an educational goal for more people to be capable of writing software, then it should be an operations goal to allow people to use their mobile devices to do so.

## From the Ground Up
When Steve Jobs originally proposed the iPhone he discussed why there shouldn't be a physical keyboard. The premise of this justification was that any screen can build any keyboard it needs specifically suited to the task. A goal of this project is to build a tightly unified text buffer and command/keyboard area that emphasize quick seamless interactions.

## npm module
This will be an npm module that you can pull into your project if you are looking for a code editor that is optimized for mobile.
